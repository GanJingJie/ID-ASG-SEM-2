# Food Recipe Searcher
My Project is about a website that is capable of giving recipes that are based on one ingredient that you have at home. By searching for one ingredient, you are able to get a whole list of Meals that have that ingredient in their recipe and you will be able to choose from there.

## Design Process
My Website is those who are interested in cooking or are locked in their own houses. With the COVID-19 situation around and the later Omicron virus, it could get harder and harder to go out to eat. There will bound to be cases where people would be interested in different thing like cooking for example. As such, I wanted to make a website that is easy for people to use without having to scour the internet searching for a recipe. 

### User type 
As a User type, it would be extremely convenient for me to be able to simply input in one ingredient and have multiple recipes given to me immediately compared to searching for a recipe and checking to see if I have that ingredient.

As a User type, I would be at home but am unable to create of anything that is unique with all the basic ingredients that I have at home. As such, this website would be able to help me by giving me a recipe that I can use just by searching for an ingredient or even a spice.

As a User type, I would be unable to choose which recipe to use that other websites normally provide as they could be extremely broad or I may be unable to access the ingredients. As such, such a website would be useful for me as I only have to input in one ingredient in order to get a whole list of recipes that utilize that ingredient that I will be able to select from.

## Features
Search for a whole list of recipes by just looking up one ingredient.

Obtain the entire recipe in one go on one page without having to scroll.

Additional filters for things religion wise such as whether is it Halal or if it contains beef for the buddhists.

### Another feature idea
Maybe can add in average cost of recipe?
## Technologies Used
Languages used were: HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

## Testing
It may bug and not display anything after a lot of tries. Unable to click enter to search and have to click the button in the search bar. Cross button and Search logo sometimes show up some times do not.

Looks fairly similar across chrome and firefox. All recipes are listed in one line down on mobile phones.
